# Applied Regression Labs

## Overview

This repository contains the lab assignments for the Applied Regression course. The labs focus on applying regression techniques to real-world datasets using R.

## Structure

Each lab folder typically includes:
- An R script (`.R`) or R Markdown file (`.Rmd`).
- A `data` folder with relevant datasets.
- An `output` folder with results, such as regression models, plots, and tables.

## Requirements

- R (version 4.x or higher)
- R Studio
- Required R packages, depending on the lab:
  - `ggplot2`
  - `dplyr`
  - `lmtest`
  - `car`
  - `broom`

You can install the necessary packages by running:
```r
install.packages(c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "lmtest", "car", "broom"))
